# TT Toss Rule Checker 🏓

TT Toss Rule Checker is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to verify the legality of a table tennis service toss.

According to ITTF regulations, the ball must be tossed nearly vertically (within 30 degrees) upward at least 16cm. This app helps players and umpires visualize and measure these metrics using their smartphone camera.
